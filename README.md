# Next.js 13 Learning 

This repository contains the code for my learning tutorial of Next.js 13 from Traversy Media's YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6KDk5iyrYE&ab_channel=TraversyMedia).

## Learnings

- In this Next.js crash course, he covers various features of Next.js version 13, including the app directory, React server components, and layout. He demonstrates building a project that displays courses on the home page and allows searching of them. He also covers naming files and folders for routing, using server components to fetch data from the GitHub API, and utilizing suspense boundaries for placeholders while loading data. He also explains how to use API route handlers, add metadata to specific routes, and import fonts. He also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of server components versus client components and how to fetch data from both types. Finally, Brad shows how to create a repository viewer with React icons, a card layout, and a clickable link to navigate to the repository page.

- Creating a route handler to search courses based on query parameters, extracting body data from a post form to add a new course, creating a search component using a client component, fetching data from the API with getServerSideProps and passing it to the page, and utilizing the loading directory feature. He also showcases how GitHub Copilot can expedite the coding process. Overall, the video is  comprehensive.
